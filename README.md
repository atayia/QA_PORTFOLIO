# Heat QA Solutions — QA Portfolio

Welcome to my Quality Assurance portfolio. I am building the Heat QA Solutions brand as a professional identity for my QA work, documenting a full testing lifecycle from strategy to execution.

This portfolio is tailored for:  
- **Recruiters** – to review my technical documentation, traceability, and risk-based testing approach.
- **Stakeholders** – to see a "deep dive" into high-complexity web ecosystems.

## 🔍 Featured Project: Amazon E-Commerce Audit

> **Disclaimer:** This project is an independent QA audit conducted for portfolio and educational purposes. Amazon is an **unofficial client**, and this work is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representative of Amazon.com, Inc.

I am currently conducting a comprehensive end-to-end audit of the Amazon web platform. Rather than shallow testing across multiple sites, this project focuses on high-risk, high-impact workflows within the world's largest e-commerce environment.

### Deep Dive Focus Areas:
* **Identity Management:** Auth flows, account security, and session persistence.
* **Search & Discovery:** Filtering logic, search relevancy, and category navigation.
* **The Golden Path:** Add-to-cart logic, inventory validation, and the multi-step checkout funnel.
* **Data Integrity:** Validating that front-end UI accurately reflects back-end database states (price changes, stock levels).

## 🛠️ Testing Deliverables

Each deliverable is presented through a **dedicated HTML interface** for recruiter-friendly navigation, emphasizing full lifecycle traceability:

1. **Test Strategy & Plans** High-level overview of scope, resource allocation, and risk-based prioritization specifically tailored for the Amazon e-commerce ecosystem.

2. **Requirements Analysis & Traceability Matrix** Detailed breakdown of Amazon business logic into testable requirements. Includes a **Traceability Matrix** mapping each requirement to its corresponding Test Case and any associated Defect IDs, ensuring 100% test coverage.

3. **Test Case Suites** Comprehensive test suites grouped by high-impact features (Authentication, Cart, Search). Each suite is linked directly to the original requirements and includes embedded screenshots as visual execution evidence.

4. **Bug Reports & Defect Tracking** Professional defect logs cross-referenced with failed Test Cases. Reports include clear reproduction steps, environment details (iPhone 12 Pro), and severity-based impact rankings.

5. **Automation (In Progress)** A Python-based framework utilizing the Page Object Model (POM) and Pytest to demonstrate how manual "Golden Path" test cases are transitioned into scalable, maintainable automated scripts.
